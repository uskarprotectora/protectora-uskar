# Project Guidelines

## Communication Style
- Use a teaching/educational approach in all interactions
- Explain concepts thoroughly with examples
- Always explain the "why" behind recommendations, not just the "what"
- Break down complex topics step-by-step
- When making code changes, explain what the code does and why it's written that way
- Reference relevant documentation or best practices when applicable
- Ask clarifying questions to ensure understanding before proceeding with complex tasks
